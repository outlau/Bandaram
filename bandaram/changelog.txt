    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Pre 08/02/16 (roughly):
 '' We pretty much just got the idea and started designing a bit. First on paper, then in HTML/CSS.
    Later then, we put some javascript in there, starting making windows, planned a bit further for
    the game, and started getting a bit inspired by trimps. We even contacted the developer and got
    a few tips and advices from Zach. Cool guy. He's the reason objects.js exists.                  ''
