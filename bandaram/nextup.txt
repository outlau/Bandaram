Next Up:
 + PNG's for arrows (should be pretty easy, right?)
 + Venues as several objects, not inside an array
 + PNG for singer
 + Hover over singer = stats information
 + Bass and keyboard in upgrades
 + All instruments in main
 + Skills for other instruments
 * refreshPriceTags() instead of refreshInstruments() in cashadd()
 * Redo design refreshing in general - too many refreshes going on, many can be spared
 * Make simple functionality for performing - progress-bar, cash-notes, venue-dependant, etc.
 

Other ideas:
 ? Unlock of new band members - how should it work? What should unlock them?
 ? Drugs
 ? Popularity
 ? Fame
 ? Studio
 ? How should performing work? All band members unavailbe while performing maybe? All gain different amounts of exp?
 ? How should recording work? Maybe a bit like performing. Grab the paper and pencil and figure both out.


Think this through (content and balancing):

 - Upgrades for keyboard
 - Skills for singer
