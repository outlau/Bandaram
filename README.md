# Bandaram
This is the source-code for Bandaram (game) all files, images, etc. included.

Preview the latest version here:
https://preview.c9users.io/citadelseven/bandaram/index.html

#### Disclaimer
We did not make the <code>jquery.transit.min.js</code> file or any of the images excluding the favicon!

## Instructions
We will write instructions for what each file does in the near future. This is what we have so far:

### CSS
In the <code>style.css</code> file you will find most of the main styling for the game. Some main styling may be found in the script-files too.

<code>scrollbars.css</code> explicitly contains the styling for our scrollbars. So far there's only one scroll-bar, but that might change. We chose to make a seperate file for this because it might be a very buggy thing and we don't see it fit to make it take space in the mail styling file. We will do this with other styling files too.

### Past and future
Look inside <code>changelog.txt</code> to see the latest features added. Not all changes are there, but most of them from 08/02/16 until now is there.

Open <code>nextup.txt</code> to see future ideas and what we need to figure out.
